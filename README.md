# SinkingModels
A little app that allows interactive feature selection and auto re-training of machine learning models for numerical and categorical data. 
A sample data file is used as an example on the titatic survivors dataset.

## Code module description:
## main.py : Main script to run the app on a browser. The app runs on the streamlit python library. Usage %run streamlit main.py
## ETL.py : ETL pipeline, generating a datfarame with all data ready for training 
## Model.py: A collection of Machine Learning model including Linear Regression, Random Forest and gradient boost algorithms. Training and feature importanc output
##DeepModels.py: Deep Learning module (work in progress)
